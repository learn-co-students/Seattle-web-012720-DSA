# Varied Anagram Maker

- Given a string, return an anagram of the string. 
- The program, given the same string, should generate a different anagram each time (results may be repeated by chance)

## Examples
```javascript
    randomGram("pokebowl")
    => "obwlkpeo"
    randomGram("pokebowl")
    => "pboowelk"
    randomGram("111115")
    => "511111"
```
