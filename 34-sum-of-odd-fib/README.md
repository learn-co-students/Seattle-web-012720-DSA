# Return the Sum of Odd Fibonacci Numbers Below a Point


- Given a positive integer N, return the sum of all odd Fibonacci numbers that are less than or equal to N.

- The first two numbers in the Fibonacci sequence are 1 and 1. Every additional number in the sequence is the sum of the two previous numbers. The first six numbers of the Fibonacci sequence are 1, 1, 2, 3, 5 and 8.

- For example, sumFibs(10) should return 10 because all odd Fibonacci numbers less than or equal to 10 are 1, 1, 3, and 5.

## Examples
```javascript
sumOddFibs(10) 
    => 10
sumOddFibs(1000) 
    => 1785
sumOddFibs(4000000) 
    => 4613732
```
