# Find the Most Repeated Number in Array

- You are a field scientist counting bird sightings. Given an array of integers, each integer representing a different type of bird, determine which "bird" appears the most times in the array and return that bird's identifying number.

- If there are two birds who tie, return the bird whose index (not identifying number) is lowest.

```javascript
    imABirdScientistDoingBirdScience([1,1,2,2,3])
        => 1
    imABirdScientistDoingBirdScience([9,3,5,6])
        => 9
    imABirdScientistDoingBirdScience([3,8,1,4,8])
        => 8
```
